Final Project - Traveling Salesman Problem

For this project, Andrew worked on the Point, Edge, and Vertex classes and Owen worked on the Graph class. We then worked together on the rest, including the main driver, Makefile, etc.

We compiled our classes all into one classes.h file because we had trouble getting them (and their implementations) to work when separated. In doing so, we had trouble getting constructors, getters, and setters to work (except for Graph class) and thus just decided to make all data public to circumvent this.

Owen taught Andrew how to use git, and we worked together in a shared repository to combine our files. We then had trouble with some unwanted overwriting of files so we just created a new repository near the end of the project to put our final files in. Owen handled all committing/pushing of files in this repository to make it simple.
